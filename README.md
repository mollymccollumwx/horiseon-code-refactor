## Purpose:

---

This project refactored the HTML and CSS for the Horiseon company web page in order to improve the functionality, readability, and accessibility. The changes made to the code include:

* Replacing `<div>` tags with semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`

* Making the web page **accessible** by adding `<alt>` attributes

* Elimnating redundant or repeating code 

* Fixing broken links 

* Consolidating and reorganzing the CSS selectors to match the semantic structure and order of the HTML 


## Usage

---

[The Deployed Wesbite](https://mollymccollumwx.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/ "Refactored Horiseon Website") now features accessibility features from video captures, screen readers, and braille keyboards. The accessibility improvements also allow for better positioning in search engines.
