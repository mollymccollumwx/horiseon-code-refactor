# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Project Purpose:

---

This project refactored the HTML and CSS for the Horiseon company web page in order to improve the functionality, readability, and accessibility. The changes made to the code include:

* Replacing `<div>` tags with semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`

* Making the web page **accessible** by adding `<alt>` attributes

* Elimnating redundant or repeating code 

* Fixing any broken links 

* Consolidating and reorganzing the CSS selectors to match the semantic structure and order of the HTML
